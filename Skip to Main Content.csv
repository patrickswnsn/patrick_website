About me
Hi! I am an award-winning digital journalist and technologist with over ten years of experience in newsroom leadership and innovation. 
 
I am based in San Francisco, where I co-founded the AI consulting lab Verso. We help newsrooms, nonprofits, and business leaders step into the AI age, drawing on deep journalistic and technical experience. Verso offers AI training, strategy consulting as well as product design and implementation. We are also available for lectures and talks.
 
Previously, I was a John S. Knight fellow at Stanford University, where I explored the impact of artificial intelligence on the information ecosystem, especially on media and journalism. I prototyped AI tools for reporters and editors, designed strategies for newsrooms, learned to code (in Python) and built skills in entrepreneurship and business development.
​
From 2013 to 2023, I was Head of Social Media for news at the Austrian Public Broadcaster ORF. In this role, I built our social presence on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook from scratch and grew it to reach a daily audience of 2.4 million followers.

My work
In my work, I focus on the intersection of news, tech and democracy. My goal is to use frontier technologies to spread facts and credible reporting, safeguard elections, improve media literacy, and fight misinformation and hate speech. 
​
As a John S. Knight fellow at Stanford, I am especially interested in the dawning age of generative artificial intelligence and exploring ideas on how to best prepare for the technology's impacts on news, media and democracy.
​
Before coming to the United States, I founded and led the social media team at Austria's largest newsroom. I pioneered strategies for news on TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook, as well as leading a series of innovative projects focused on digital storytelling, audience engagement, trust in media and transparency.

John S. Knight Fellowship at Stanford University
As a John S. Knight fellow at Stanford, I explored the impact of artificial intelligence on the information ecosystem, focused particularly on news, journalism and elections.

During my fellowship, I worked on a range of projects around tech, information and media:
 
Built and prototyped AI tools for reporters and editors in collaboration with my JSK colleague Kaveh Waddell and partners at the Computer Science department and NLP group
 
Developed AI strategies for media organizations, including workshops and training programs for newsrooms
 
Explored the potential of AI for leadership training, designing my own chatbot to practice difficult conversations
 
​Researched AI policy, ethics and election integrity, learned to code in Python, and built entrepreneurship and business skills

The JSK Fellowship is a highly selective ten month long program that aims to improve the public's access to information by fostering innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership in media.

My work
TikTok (@zeitimbild)
One of my recent projects is @zeitimbild on TikTok. This account was launched in October 2021. In less than two years, it grew to over 450,000 followers and is now the largest news account on the platform in Austria.
​
For TikTok, we created and implemented a new form of talent-driven video journalism that is tailored to GenZ. It uses the native visual language of the platform and leverages fun and forward-thinking storytelling techniques while remaining firmly committed to the highest standards of thoughtful independent journalism.

On this project, I oversaw the look and feel of our content, collaboratively developed new formats in vertical video and assigned stories. The main video hosts and producers for TikTok are Ambra Schuster and Idan Hanin.
​
This approach to TikTok has proven to be successful and the presence on the platform is growing rapidly. It is especially popular with teenagers in Austria.​

My work
Instagram (@zeitimbild)
On Instagram, @zeitimbild is the most important and largest news account in Austria. It is a key source of information for young people between the ages of 18 and 30. Launched in September 2019, the account has grown to one million followers by the summer of 2023.
​
The news coverage on the platform focuses on short-form vertical videos for storytelling and makes creative use of text, photo, graphics and data visualization.
 
On this project, I oversaw our daily news coverage, including breaking news and live events. I developed and refined our templates and designs, defined special areas of coverage, assigned editors and producers, and produced many of our postings and videos. I wrote social copy, chose photos, created and animated graphics and generated ideas for interactive stories and user outreach initiatives. 
 
In December 2022, I developed and implemented an updated video strategy for Instagram Reels. That month, we reached a new record of more than 32 million video views in a single month - an average of more than one million video views per day.
